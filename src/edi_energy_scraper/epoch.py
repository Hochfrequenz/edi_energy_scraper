    An Epoch describes the time range in which documents are valid.
    It's relative to the current time, meaning that CURRENT documents are valid now, PAST documents are not valid
    anymore, and FUTURE documents will become valid in the future.
    But running the script at a different time may change the Epoch of a document.
