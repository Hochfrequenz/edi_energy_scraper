The Python package `edi_energy_scraper` provides easy to use methods to mirror the website edi-energy.de.

### Rationale / Why?

If you'd like to be informed about new regulations or data formats being published on edi-energy.de you can either

- visit the site every day and hope that you see the changes if this is your favourite hobby,
- or automate the task.

This repository helps you with the latter. It allows you to create an up-to-date copy of edi-energy.de on your local
computer. Other than if you mirrored the files using `wget` or `curl`, you'll get a clean and intuitive directory
structure.

From there you can e.g. commit the files into a VCS, scrape the PDF/Word files for later use...

We're all hoping for the day of true digitization on which this repository will become obsolete.

## How to use the Package (as a user)

Install via pip:

```bash
pip install edi_energy_scraper
```

Create a directory in which you'd like to save the mirrored data:

```bash
mkdir edi_energy_de
```

Then import it and start the download:

```python
import asyncio

from edi_energy_scraper import EdiEnergyScraper


async def mirror():
    scraper = EdiEnergyScraper(path_to_mirror_directory="edi_energy_de")
    await scraper.mirror()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(mirror())
```

This creates a directory structure:

```
-|-your_script_cwd.py
 |-edi_energy_de
    |- past (contains archived files)
        |- ahb.pdf
        |- ahb.docx
        |- ...
    |- current (contains files valid as of today)
        |- mig.pdf
        |- mig.docx
        |- ...
    |- future (contains files valid in the future)
        |- allgemeine_festlegungen.pdf
        |- schema.xsd
        |- ...
```
